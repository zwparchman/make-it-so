  * Thank you to Maria Adamsky's sln2mak project which gave me some ideas about how to write MakeItSo (though none of the code from it was used). You may want to check it out as an alternative to MakeItSo: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cross-platform/sln2mak.aspx

  * Thanks to Maxim Gready for the project name.
